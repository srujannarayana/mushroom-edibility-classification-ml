# mushroom-edibility-classification-ml
This project predicts whether mushrooms are edible or poisonous using machine learning. After cleaning and analyzing features like cap shape, odor, and gill size, models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were applied. Odor and gill traits showed strong influence, helping achieve high classification accuracy.
